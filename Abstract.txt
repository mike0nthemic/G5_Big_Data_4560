This paper explains the method and processes we
used to determine the average age range, people who had 
underlying conditions and how they reacted, the mortality 
rate in the United States from those that had contracted 
COVID-19 in each state, and to see if there a large difference 
between both genders in death rates. By looking at 
characteristics and demographics like a personâ€™s age, health, 
and sex we can understand the severity of COVID-19 
throughout the United States. Our research paper focuses on 
how we handle this big data set using Hadoop and beeline. 
Along with that, we have also analyzed the data visually
using the tools Excel and Power BI. From these tools we will 
have created map visualizations and different types of charts..
